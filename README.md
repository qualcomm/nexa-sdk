## Directory Structure

- All libraries and tools intended for external release are placed in the repository root
- Dependencies are managed through the build system rather than by directory layout
- Use a single unified build system to avoid complexity caused by different subprojects using different build tools

## Bazel

- Advantages
  - Supports C++/Go/Python/Android and can package Docker images
  - Integrates lint/test/build, so CI only needs to run Bazel commands; local development can also use Bazel to maintain consistency
  - Uses a self-maintained toolchain, unaffected by the system environment
  - Easier to integrate custom build rules compared to CMake
- Disadvantages
  - May be overly complex for small projects (but our project spans multiple languages and platforms)
  - Steeper learning curve (there are plenty of resources; AI can help)

### Common Commands

- `bazel query //...` list all targets in the workspace
- `bazel run //cli:geniex` build and run the CLI target, will not build full project.

#### go tips

- `bazel run //gazelle` update BUILD files from `go.mod`
- `# gazelle:resolve go ://example.com //local/foo:go_default_library` resolve external go module to local bazel target

## Notes

- All tutorials, cookbook and sample apps are in a separate repo [geniex-app](https://github.com/geniex-app).
- Should we keep `dlopen` plugins? There are only two plugins now, and both exist on windows/linux arm64.
- Since we will open source all the code, maybe we can static link everything for simplicity.
